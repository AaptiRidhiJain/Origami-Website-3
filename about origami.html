    <h1>LEARN MORE ABOUT ORIGAMI!!</h1>

    <p>Origami is a very popular craft today. It helped inspire the book Sadako and the Thousand Paper Cranes, 
       which was later turned into a movie. The art form has even inspired the design of things
       like airbags and heart stents. Origami sculptures can be fascinating.</p>  

    <p>The Japanese word, “origami” is a combination of two words in Japanese: “ori” which means “to fold” and
       “kami” which means “paper”. ... Traditionally, it was believed that if one folded 1000 origami cranes,
       one's wish would come true. It has also become a symbol of hope and healing during challenging times.</p>

     <p>Robert J. Lang has been an avid student of origami for more than 40 years and is now recognizedas one of the  
        world's leading masters of the art. He is noted for designs of great detail and realism,and is one of the 
        pioneers of mathematical origami. Lang's work has been exhibited in museums around the world.</p>

        <b><h2>HOW IS IT USED TODAY??</h2></b>

     <p>While we think of origami as art, it increasingly is being used by companies and researchers in space,
        medicine, robotics, architecture, public safety and the military to solve vexing design problems, often  
        to fit big things into small spaces.</p>
     <p>Architecture and Civil Engineering: Origami is used in the manufacturing of miniature models of bridges and stadiums. 
         ... Mathematics: Some teachers currently use origami as an educational tool that helps in clarifying geometry, 
         explaining fractions, and solving problems.</p>
     <p>Origami excites other modalities of learning. It has been shown to improve spatial visualization skills
        using hands-on learning. Such skills allow children to comprehend, characterize, and construct their own
        vernacular for the world around them.</p>
     <p>NASA engineers use origami not only because of its aesthetic appeal, but also because of the hidden geometry
        in the various folds.</p>
